[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ravinder09/logistic_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ravinder09/logistic_api)

## About

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as the container service to isolate the environment.
- [Php](https://php.net/) to develop backend support.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) as the server framework / controller layer
- [MySQL](https://mysql.com/) as the database layer
- [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/content-caching/) as a proxy / content-caching layer

## How to Install & Run

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Set Google Distance API key in environment file located in ./code .env file
3.  Run `./start.sh` to build docker containers, executing migration and PHPunit test cases
4.  After starting container following will be executed automatically:
	- Table migrations using artisan migrate command.
	- Dummy Data imports using artisan db:seed command.

## Manually Migrating tables and Data Seeding

1. To run manually migrations use this command `docker exec delivery_php php artisan migrate`
2. To run manually data import use this command `docker exec delivery_php php artisan db:seed`

## Manually Starting the docker and test Cases

1. You can run `docker-compose up` from terminal
2. Server is accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
3. Run manual testcase suite by :
	- Integration test by this `docker exec delivery_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Feature/OrderControllerTest.php` &
	- Unit Tests by this `docker exec delivery_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Unit/OrderUnitTest.php`

## How to Run Tests (Explicity from cli)

 Test Cases can be executed by:
- Integration test by this `docker exec delivery_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Feature/OrderControllerTest.php` &
